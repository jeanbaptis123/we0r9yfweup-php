<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>ProxyScrape has partnered up with CroxyProxy to provide a reliable web-proxy, therefor their policies described below also apply when using ProxyScrape's web-proxy.</p>
<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<p>We take user's privacy very seriously, and will not knowingly disclose confidential information to anyone. However, we reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement agencies who are investigating criminal activities undertaken by users of our service.
<br><br>
In logging access to this service, we try to balance our need to have access to useful service performance data and the need to be able to cooperate with criminal investigations with our user's needs for privacy. Currently our goal is to log only information which is necessary to comply with legitimate law enforcement inquiries for a period of 30 days from the date of access. The data recorded includes information provided by your browser such as your user agent and referring page as well as the requested URL, the time and date, and your IP address. This logging policy is a goal and not a mandate. We also may use third-party web statistics services to collect and analyze general visitors' behaviour in order to improve the service performance.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This service is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. Use of this service is entirely at your own risk. We cannot take responsibility for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use of this service.
<br><br>
The information, services and products available to you on this website may contain errors and are subject to periods of interruption. While we do our best to maintain the information, services and products it offers, we can not be held responsible for any errors, defects, lost profits or other consequential damages arising from the use of the service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br><br>
PROXYSCRAPE PROVIDES THE INFORMATION, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AVAILABLE ON THIS WEBSITE "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
<br><br>
IN NO EVENT SHALL PROXYSCRAPE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, ARISING FROM THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS WEBSITE OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE, EVEN IF PROXYSCRAPE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THIS WEBSITE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE TO STOP USING THE WEBSITE.
<br><br>
The service allows indirect browsing of external, third-party websites. The term "indirect browsing" refers to the server which you connect to. During "direct" browsing, you connect to the server which provides the resource you are requesting. During "indirect" browsing, you connect to our server and it downloads the requested resource and forwards it to you.
<br><br>
We are not responsible for the content on any external websites that may be accessible through our service. We will not be responsible for any contamination or damage a user sustains as a result of entering a website through the service. A website viewed through our service is in no way owned by or associated with this service.
<br><br>
By connecting to our server instead of the target server, the target server does not see your IP address. However, we do not guarantee our service will be fully anonymous. The downloaded resource may reference other resources which your browser may automatically download. The service attempts to reroute all such requests through our server but may not be entirely successful.
<br><br>
Any resource (such as web pages, images, files) downloaded through our service may be modified. The resource which you receive may not be an accurate representation of the resource requested.</p>
