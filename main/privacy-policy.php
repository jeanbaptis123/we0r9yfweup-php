<h2>1 WHY THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
<p>Every person who visits or uses the Website (hereafter: the “<strong>Visitor</strong>”) as well as every person who relies on our services (hereafter: the “<strong>Customer</strong>”) will in most cases disclose a certain amount of personal data. The personal data is information which allows PROXYSCRAPE to identify you as a natural person, regardless of whether we actually do this.

The Visitor and the Customer are hereinafter also jointly referred to as the "Data Subject".</p>
<p>We only use and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR and any replacement legislation, or any similar regulation under any applicable law, and any regulatory requirements or codes of practice governing the use, storage or transmission of personal data.

<p>The User provides the personal data to PROXYSCRAPE himself and therefore retains a certain degree of control. PROXYSCRAPE reserves the right to suspend or cancel certain operations if the required personal data is missing, incorrect or incomplete.</p>
<h2>6 WHO RECEIVES YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
<p>Your personal data will only be processed for internal use within PROXYSCRAPE.

We may work together with different cyber security authorities when requested to prevent the misuse of our proxies.</p>
<h2>7 HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h2>

<p>Your personal data is solely processed for the legitimate purposes explained in point 5. Your personal is collected and processed in an appropriate, relevant and non-excessive manner, and is not kept longer than necessary to achieve the intended purposes.</p>
<p><strong>8.2 Right to access</strong></p>

<p><strong>8.3 Right to rectification of your personal data</strong></p>

    <li>You withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other legal ground for processing;</li>
    <li>You have validly exercised your right of opposition;</li>
    <li>Your personal data has been illegally processed;</li>

<p><strong>8.6 Right to object</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
