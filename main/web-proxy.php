<p>About 3.8 billion people are online every day. From sharing content to collecting data for organizational purposes, there are about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being processed by Google every day. Not all data is available to all people around the world. For example, a show on Netflix in one country may not be available in another country. This is due to restrictions and copyrights imposed by the government of the respective country. Web proxy is the easiest way to access all restricted content without having to install any kind of software.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is a Web Proxy?</h2>
<p>A web proxy allows you to browse the web anonymously and unblock your favorite websites without installing software, like a VPN. Our web proxy is free and supports the most popular websites, such as YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and adult entertainment websites. All your traffic is encrypted while browsing to make sure you stay anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Does Web Proxy Work?</h2>
<p>A Web Proxy has its own IP address, which acts as the intermediary between the user and the internet. Once the user requests information online, the request is routed via a web proxy, the web proxy retrieves the information from the targeted website, then sends it to the user. This way the user's local IP address is masked.</p>
<h2>Why Do You Need a Web Proxy?</h2>
<p>For an average user, a web proxy helps to access the restricted content behind geoblocking in websites and streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This is carried out without compromising the internet connectivity speed. With ProxyScrape, you can surf restricted websites without annoying ads and other constraints. Simply paste the URL or type the website name and you will be directed to the website home page. It's that quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second aspect of the need for web proxy is to improve network performance. For example, let us say that you visited an XYZ website in the morning. The web proxy saves the data from the webpage temporarily, so when you visit it again in early noon, it actually serves you a copy of the webpage and reduces the latency.</p>
<h2>The Difference between Web Proxy and VPN</h2>
<p>Web proxy servers and VPNs both act as an intermediary between the user and a website. Web proxies and VPNs both receive a request from the user, get a response from the targeted websites, and route it to the user again. The main differences between proxy servers and VPNs are how they work and which protocols they support, which affects their privacy and security capabilities.</p>
<p>VPNs are typically configured at a system level, allowing all traffic to pass through them, i.e., web browsing, music streaming, file sharing, or gaming. Many VPN software solutions allow users to exclude selected apps from operating through the VPN, but the default settings usually direct all traffic through them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a web proxy can be accessed directly from the browser and does not require software installation. However, the disadvantage is that a web proxy can only open websites and can not mask your IP address for other applications on your device. A web proxy is ideal if you quickly need to visit a blocked website without downloading any type of software.</p>
